    <p>I‚Äôm a Mechanical Engineer with a strong passion for innovation, efficiency, and strategy. I recently graduated from UW‚ÄìMadison, where I specialized in manufacturing and operations. Throughout my internships at Doosan Bobcat and Vertiv, I led high-impact projects, from streamlining production processes using Lean manufacturing and Six Sigma principles to contributing to executive-level strategy presentations through data-driven analysis.</p>
    <p>I enjoy bridging the gap between technical engineering and business strategy. Whether I‚Äôm optimizing a paint line workflow using value stream mapping and time studies, presenting to senior leadership with actionable KPIs, or mentoring new interns on CAD modeling and process documentation, I bring a can-do spirit and a focus on results.</p>
    <p>I‚Äôm actively seeking full-time roles in manufacturing engineering, operations, or strategy, where I can continue solving real world problems with creativity and precision. My technical toolkit includes proficiency in SolidWorks, AutoCAD, FEA, GD&T, ERP systems (like SAP), and continuous improvement methodologies.</p>

Conducted site assessments and operator interviews to identify inefficiencies at the pound-out table and paint line unload station. Proposed and evaluated multiple solutions using CAD, SolidWorks animations, and Pugh matrices. Final recommendations were aligned with Lean principles and presented to company engineers and management.",
